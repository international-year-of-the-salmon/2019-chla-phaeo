Chlorophyll a and Phaeopigment Concentration sampling protocols from the 2019 Gulf of Alaska International Year of the Salmon Expedition

The oceanographic survey will be conducted to assess the winter salmon habitat. It will use a salmon-oriented approach: a descriptive oceanography of the northeastern Pacific. At every grid station, a CTD (SBE-25, additional sensors will include pH, oxygen and fluorescence) will be deployed to a depth of 1000 m. The CTD will be equipped with a rosette holding 12 5-l Niskin bottles that will collect water samples from standard depths: 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 400, 600 and 1000 m. 

From collected water samples, macronutrients (nitrates, phosphates and silicates), dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a (in the top 200 m only) will be measured onboard deploying standard hydro-chemical methods. In addition, replicate water samples will be frozen for a subsequent macronutrient analysis in the laboratory.   

Equipment permitting, abiotic conditions in the upper layer (0-100 ?) will be measured using an underway CTD-O2 to understand salmon conditions during the trawl survey. This will be supplementing surface underway measurements. In addition, a 10-3 accuracy thermometer will be installed in the "fish-box" when live salmon will be collected. Both measurements are designated to obtain small-scale depth/temperature/salinity/dissolved oxygen variables within the salmon habitat.
